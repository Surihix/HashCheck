# HashCheck

This app helps in computing SHA-256 hashes of two files, compares them and returns a message mentioning whether they match or do not match. this is pretty 
useful when you want to compare two different files that have the same binary data but different filenames.

### App usage
You just have to provide two files as arguments with this app and launch it. the app should then get the hashes for both of the files and say whether 
they match or do not match. do note that the app will take a bit more time than normal when getting the hash for a larger file.
